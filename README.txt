The two exercises are nopthing complex and anyone can run them with little effort

The first exercise only requirement is that you keep all 3 files
snake.html, snake.css and snake.js in the same level directory because
that is where the html is gonna look for them.

One is the actual facets of programming and the other gives it a little order and color

The second exercise uses a library called "Inquirer.js" that is in charge of reading input
from the console and can be installed using the command => "npm install inquirer"
Plase install Inquirer.js and afterwards run the exercise by typing => "node hw3.js"

That is all folks!
